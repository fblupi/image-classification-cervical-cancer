## Strategies

### Only CNNs

* Learning from scratch
* Using a previously trained neural network
* Transfer learning/fine tuning

Using multiclass classification, OVO and OVA

### CNNs + others classifiers (SVM, Boosting)

* CNN feature maps from a previously trained neural network
* CNN feature maps from an own neural network
